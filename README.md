I'm pleased to announce that I have completed the Belajar Pengembangan Aplikasi Android Intermediate certification from Dicoding Indonesia! ðŸš€ðŸ“±

This course, part of my journey with Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka covered advanced topics in Android development, including advanced UI, animation, localization and accessibility, services, media, geo-location, advanced testing, advanced database, and Firebase. For my final project, I developed a story app with photo-sharing capabilities and Paging implementation, meeting all the criteria set by Google and achieving a high score and I was inspired to create the Canary logo design by my father's canary bird.

## Features

- MMVM Architecture
- Localization for Support Dual-Language
- Media (Gallery, Camera & CameraX
- Geo Location (Maps with Google Maps API)
- Pagination : Room DB (Paging 3 with RemoteMediator)
